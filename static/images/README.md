# Image Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder images for the Kingsman Space & Services website.

## Required Images:

### Logos:
- `walkwins-logo.png` - Walkwins app logo (64x64px recommended)
- `zobcy-logo.png` - Zobcy app logo (64x64px recommended)
- `favicon.ico` - Website favicon (32x32px)

### Walkwins Screenshots:
- `walkwins1.png` through `walkwins8.png` - App screenshots for slideshow
- Recommended size: 300x600px (mobile app screenshots)
- Should showcase key features of the Walkwins app

## Image Guidelines:
- Use high-quality images for better user experience
- Ensure images are optimized for web (compressed but good quality)
- Screenshots should be actual app screenshots or high-fidelity mockups
- Logos should have transparent backgrounds (PNG format)

## Fallback System:
The website includes SVG fallbacks for all images, so the site will work even without actual image files. The fallbacks display:
- Colored placeholder rectangles with letters (W for Walkwins, Z for Zobcy)
- Screenshot placeholders with app names and numbers

## Adding Real Images:
1. Replace the placeholder image files with your actual images
2. Keep the same filenames as referenced in the HTML
3. Ensure proper image optimization for web performance
